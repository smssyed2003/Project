Attribute Information:
Given are the variable name, variable type, the measurement unit and a brief description. The concrete compressive strength determination is the objective of the regression task. The order of this listing corresponds to the order of numerals along the rows of the database.

Model Comparison Report

Create a report stating the performance of multiple models on this data and suggest the best model for production.

Report on Challenges faced

Create a report which should include challenges you faced on data and what technique was used with proper reason.

Note:- All above tasks should be created on a single jupyter notebook and the same must be shared as part of the final submission of the project.
